# Project 3 API: MMO & Co.

The back-end API for Blog App: MMO & Co. using an `express` auth template. This API is built off authentication and middlware boilerplates. This API along with AXIOS is used to service the client for MMO & Co.. MMO & Co. is a blogging app that allows users to create and log stories and share them with other users.

## Structure

Dependencies are stored in [`package.json`](package.json)
The express `app` is housed in `server.js`. Routefiles are registered within this file, additional middleware must be added to this file as well.

The `app` directory contains models and route files. Models are used to structure objects in Mongoose. Route files are used as controllers that handles the RESTful routes for the application.

Within `app/models` is seed.js which will add initial database objects. Objects will be cleared when the script for seed.js is run, so only use it to reset the DB.

Within `app/lib` are files used to service token authentication, error handling, custom classes for errors and methods to catch errors and set response status codes. The error messages and handlers can be changed within these files.
